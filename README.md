This is a temporary portfolio(personal) which I built using HTML CSS and JS.
It is a fully responsive design compatible with most of the devices.
So far the features added into the frontend include:
Section Navigation on click
Vanishing of navbar on navigation to the section.
Home
About Section
Skills Section
Works section
Contact Section
(The photographs used in the page are just for an example)
Please find the source Code and files attached to this repo.
(I've taken some references from the YouTube as well.)
